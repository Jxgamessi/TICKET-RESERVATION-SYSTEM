Bus Reservation System :  This PHP-based system offers a straightforward yet feature-rich way to handle bus reservations. Administrators can control busses, view bookings, and more, while users may register, log in, purchase tickets, and cancel bookings. The system has CSV file data durability, input validation, and secure user authentication. Designed as a project to showcase web development principles and PHP programming abilities.

1. Install PHP with XAMPP :
   - XAMPP is a software package that includes PHP, Apache, MySQL, and Perl, allowing you to set up a local web server environment on your computer.
   - Download the XAMPP installer from the official website (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and follow the installation instructions.
   - During installation, make sure to include PHP in the components to be installed.

2. Download the Code and CSV Files :
   - Download the code files for the Bus Reservation System and the necessary CSV files.
   - You can download these files from the repository or the source where they are provided.

3. Place Files in htdocs Directory :
   - Navigate to the 'htdocs' folder within your XAMPP installation directory. This folder is typically located at 'C:\xampp\htdocs' on Windows.
   - Copy the downloaded PHP code file ('Bus_ticket_reservation_system.php') and the CSV files ('buses.csv' and 'users.csv') into this 'htdocs' folder.

4. Verify File Paths :
   - Ensure that the files are placed in the correct directory with the specified names:
     - Bus Reservation System PHP code file: 'C:\xampp\htdocs\Bus_ticket_reservation_system.php'
     - Buses CSV file: 'C:\xampp\htdocs\buses.csv'
     - Users CSV file: 'C:\xampp\htdocs\users.csv'
   - The system relies on these file paths to access the PHP code and the data stored in the CSV files.

5. Run the Code :
   - Open your command prompt or terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where you placed the PHP code and CSV files. You can use the `cd` command to change directories.
   - Once in the correct directory, execute the PHP code file by running the command `php Bus_ticket_reservation_system.php` in the command prompt.
   - Alternatively, you can open the PHP code file ('Bus_ticket_reservation_system.php') in your preferred code editor and run it from there if your editor supports executing PHP scripts.
   - After executing the code, the system will start running on your local server.
